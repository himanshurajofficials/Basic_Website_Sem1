<h2><u> 2th MOST POPULATED COUNTRY </u> </h2>
<p><em>This is second only to 21.03 per cent of China but is much higher than 12 per cent of the entire continent of Africa, 9.4 per cent of Europe and 4.63 per cent of the USA.

Our population is more than the population of the USA, Russia, Canada, Australia and Brazil put together. India’s total population is about 3.6 times that of USA, 6 times that of Brazil, 7 times that of Russian Federation, 33 times that of Canada and 55 times that of Australia.

About three-fourths of our total population is living in rural areas, indicating that we are basically depending on agriculture and other primary activities. India’s population is growing at a very fast rate. The average growth-rate for the 81-91 decade was 2.38 per cent per annum.

However, it slowed down a little bit and was recorded at 2.15 per cent per annum for 1991-2001 decade. Even at this rate of growth, our annual growth of population is equivalent to the total population of Australia. If the present rate of growth continues, <strong>India’s population will be doubled in a period of just 32 years.</em></strong></p>
<h2><u> MOST CULTURAL COUNTRY </u></h2>
<p><em>CULTURE OF INDIA reflects the beliefs, social structure and religious inclinations of the people of India. India is culturally diverse country with every region with its own distinct culture, reflected in the language, clothes and traditions of the people. People of one state are completely different on cultural grounds, from the people of other state; nevertheless, they follow one rule of law.</em>s
<em>Culture also acts as the window of India to the outside world. By looking at the various cultures of India one gets to admire its diversity and also gets to know the religious beliefs of the people and their glorious past. For Indian people, culture is a way of life, it is something that is deeply ingrained in their soul. It is a way of life, a rule book which defines their conduct, society, festivals etc.</em></p><br> <br>

<h3><strong><u>INDIAN ARMY</strong></u><br></h3>

<img src="image41.jpeg"; width=1500px;height=700px;>

<p><a href="https://joinindianarmy.nic.in"> INDIAN ARMY </a><em> needs no introduction. We all have love, respect and admiration for our soldiers and the Indian army as a whole. As we all know, Indian army has a long and glorious history. Therefore, it is difficult to talk about everything in such a limited space. Still I have tried to touch all the main points and also have tried to speak my heart out. I hope you will be able to appreciate my efforts and the essays<br>Indian armed forces are divided into three parts – Indian army, Indian Airforce and the Indian Navy. Indian army is the land-based unit, while Indian Airforce deals in air defence and Indian Navy is the naval unit. Our Indian army is the second largest in the world with about 1.23 million personnel on active rolls and another 9.6 lakhs in reserves.<br>Indian army is mainly responsible to protect the country against land based attacks. It also lends a helping hand to other agencies in dealing with terrorism, tackling emergency situations in the country and also rescuing people in case of natural calamities like flood, earthquake etc.
